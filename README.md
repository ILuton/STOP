## Description

The last couple of years of living with the threat of COVID and other diseases have heightened our awareness of the need for funding for medical research. We have designed a site that will give users the opportunity to contribute to research projects of their choosing and collect badges for their contributions.

## Contribute

In order to create this application, we used the skills we have at the moment. We are open to suggestions, if there are ways to streamline the code or if any bugs are found.

There are areas we would like to explore for future development such as:

- Adding a form for users to suggest future projects to add to the site
- Adding ability to update email and password on profile page
- Adding ability to see how much money has been donated to each project
- Adding ability to see how many donors each project has
- Adding news feed filtered to show research area related news articles 
- Suggesting other items users might like to add to their cart at checkout 
- Adding incentives based on dollar amounts donated (get a stuffed sheep)
